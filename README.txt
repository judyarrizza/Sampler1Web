To start the project, use `npm start`. It will automatically compile and serve the project at https://localhost:4201

If you have not already added the loanDepot Shared Components SSL certificate to your Trusted Root Certificate Authority, you will need to do so. See .\ssl\README.txt for more information.

The Shared Components UI projects are setup to enable quick local development by utilizing a bootstrapping code that is only used in non-production builds.

See .\src\app\app.component.ts to view the bootstrapping code.

In there, you can control properties such as the loan, environment, and single sign on token.

To enable quick iterations, during non-production builds, a single sign on token is automatically generated by calling the POS API and setting it for you.

Feel free to check in extra bootstrapping code as you develop such as adding loans to test with.
